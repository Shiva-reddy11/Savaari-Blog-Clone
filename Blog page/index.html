    <h2 style="background-color:rgb(200, 235, 242);">History About Charminar<hr></h2>
   <p><b>Most </b>monumental structures built in the past had a strong reason behind their construction. Here is the Charminar story. During the late 16th Century, Hyderabad was suffering due to a plague epidemic that was taking thousands of lives. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the Qutb Shahi dynasty who was the ruler of Hyderabad at that time prayed that if the plague ended, he would build a monument to mark the end of the horrors. This led to the birth of the monument in the heart of the old city in 1591.

    Over the years, the monument has become an iconic structure of Hyderabad and synonymous with the rich culture and heritage of the city. The impressive Charminar architecture and the vibrant atmosphere of the market surrounding it attract thousands of tourists from around the world.</p><br>
     <h2 style="background-color:rgb(200, 235, 242);">Architecture of Charminar<hr></h2>
     <b>The</b> Qutb Shahi style of architecture is a unique combination of Persian and Indian architectural styles. Charminar is the best example of the Qutb Shahi architecture. It is built using granite and lime mortar, materials that were widely used in monuments at that time. It has four 56-meter-tall minarets and a square base of 20 meters on each side. Additionally, it has four ornamental arches facing east, west, north, and south. Each arch is 11 meters wide and 20 meters in height. Every arch has a gate that opens into a courtyard.<br>

<ul>
    <li>East Gate: This was known as Kali Kaman or the Black Gate and was used by the Royal Family.</li>
    <li>West Gate: This was known as the Makkah Gate as it opened in the direction of the holy city of Mecca</li>
     <li>North Gate: This led to the mosque that was built on the top floor of the Charminar</li>
     <li>South Gate: This led to Char Kaman or a junction of four roads </li>
  </ul>
 <p><b>The </b> used were skilled and their craftsmanship can be seen in the carvings and stucco work on the minarets. You can also find geometric patterns, calligraphy, and floral motifs on them.

   Apart from its structural beauty, the Charminar is also an engineering marvel. The minarets work as ventilation shafts that help the circulation of air inside the structure. It also has functional drainage and water supply systems.</p>
